The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.
The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.
By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) that reads n characters from the file.
Note:
The read function will only be called once for each test case.

int read(char *buf, int n) {
	int res = 0;
	int count = 4;
	while (n > 0 && count == 4) {
		count = read4(buf + res);
		res += count;
		n -= 4
	}
	return res;
}
